However, neither is true. With only little practice, Java byte code becomes easy to read and can give true insights into the functioning of a Java program. In this talk, we will cast light on compiled Java code and its interplay with the Java virtual machine. In the process, we will look into the evolution of byte code over the recent major releases with features such as dynamic method invocation which is the basis to Java 8 lambda expressions. Finally, we will learn about tools for the run time generation of Java classes and how these tools are used to build modern frameworks and libraries. Among those tools, I present Byte Buddy, an open source tool of my own efforts and an attempt to considerably simplify run time code generation in Java.

In this session, we will start with an overview of Java EE 7 focussing mainly on WebSocket API(JSR 356), JSON Processing API (JSR-353), JAX-RS 2.0(JSR-339), CDI (JSR-346), and JPA 2.1 (JSR-338). After introducing these APIs, we will develop an application using these APIs live on stage. The application will use JAX-RS for RESTful API, JPA for data persistence, and CDI to wire things together. To add realtime behaviour to our application, we will use JSR 356 WebSocket API. The application will be deployed on Wildfly application server running on OpenShift platform-as-a-service. The application front end will be written using AngularJS, which will consume the RESTful backend.","created":{"date":1403367952869},"experience":{"value":"n","label":"Novice"},"language":{"value":"e","label":"English"},"speaker":{"_id":{"$oid":"53a5afca70f6aba33d9e5c14"},"actif":1.0,"bio":"Shekhar Gulati is a developer and OpenShift evangelist working with Red Hat.

Easy stuff – that’s the way we work. Hard stuff - empathy; we assume others build same abstractions and we are quickly on the same page. They don’t.\n\nIn this session I aim to fall back to design 101; take some design principles and show how they are reflected in code.

Inadequate models of physical measurements can lead to programmatic errors. In particular when modelling a measurement as a simple number with no regard to the units it represents creates fragile code. Another developer or part of the system can misinterpret the number as a different unit. For example, it may be unclear whether a person's mass is expressed in pounds, kilograms, or stones. A human reading „10°C“, „10 C“ or simply „10 Degrees“ may interpret each of those correctly. For M2M communication, unless a program contains a „Babel Fish“, such ambiguity would not be acceptable.\nDon’t Panic: After programming languages like Ada, C++, Eiffel or F# added type-safe Unit support already, JSR 363, Units of Measurement API adds similar support to the Java Platform, making it competitive for M2M in the Internet of Things with strong emphasis on sensors. \nThis session provides an overview of popular use cases for the Units of Measurement JSR and implementations on both Java ME 8 Embedded (CLDC 8) and Java SE. A Hitchhiker’s guide across places where this JSR helps improve data quality or save lives by ensuring e.g. a patient receives the correct dosage of medicine or smart homes and similar energy saving measures prevents Earth from being destroyed by Global Warming (rather than waiting for a Vogon express route ;-)","created":{"date":1.40223985895E+12},"experience":{"value":"n","label":"Novice"},"language":{"value":"e","label":"English"},"otherSpeakers":[{"lname":"","id":"Mohamed Taman"}],"speaker":{"_id":{"$oid":"5394789970f6aba33d9e5bc7"},"actif":1.0,"bio":"Werner Keil is Agile Coach, Principal Consultant and Distinct Architect for a leading provider of Embedded and Realtime solutions after working as Build Manager at Maersk and as Agile Coach, Principal Consultant and Distinct Architect for a Financial Services company.

I don't want to watch that movie so I have to convince her somehow that we should watch football match instead. Being a web developer, I decided to build a web application that would parse the tweet stream about the movie and give us the overall sentiment about the movie. If more that 60% people have positively tweeted about the movie then we would watch the movie otherwise we would watch the football match. To help others like me I decided to host it in the public cloud so that I can share the application URL with others.\n\nTo build this publicly accessible web application, we need application stack that includes language runtime, server, database, version control system, public DNS,etc. Configuring and setting up all these myself would consume all my time. Is there an automated solution that can help me get away from doing low level stuff so that I can focus on application development? PaaS or Platform as a Service is an awesome sauce for developers that can automate all the above mentioned and give you a template application that you can hack on.\n\nIn this session, we will first take a look at what is platform as a service and why you need PaaS with OpenShift as an example. Then we will look at the application source code I developed to convince my friend. The application is built using Spring framework 4 and MongoDB.","created":{"date":1403368215045},"experience":{"value":"n","label":"Novice"},"language":{"value":"e","label":"English"},"speaker":{"_id":{"$oid":"53a5afca70f6aba33d9e5c14"},"actif":1.0,"bio":"Shekhar Gulati is a developer and OpenShift evangelist working with Red Hat.

As such, it is important for Java developers to understand the actions you can take in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms, as well as in your application architecture choices. In this presentation, Ivan Krylov (Azul Systems) reviews and classifies the various garbage collectors and collection techniques available in JVMs today. Following a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques including generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent and mostly-concurrent algorithms, he defines terms and metrics common to all collectors. He classifies each major JVM collector's mechanisms and characteristics and discuss the tradeoffs involved in balancing requirements for responsiveness, throughput, space, and available memory across varying scale levels.","created":{"date":1403260756884},"experience":{"value":"e","label":"Expert"},"language":{"value":"e","label":"English"},"speaker":{"_id":{"$oid":"53a40db570f6aba33d9e5c0a"},"actif":1.0,"bio":"JVM developer at Azul Systems.

On its own this provides a great way to simplify situations where we would typically use an inner class today.  However, Java SE 8 also introduces a range of new classes in the standard libraries that are designed specifically to take advantage of Lambdas.   These are primarily included in two new packages: java.util.stream and java.util.function.\n\nAfter a brief discussion of the syntax and use of Lambda expressions this session will focus on how to use Streams to greatly simplify the way bulk and aggregate operations are handled in Java.   We will look at examples of how a more functional approach can be taken in Java using sources, intermediate operations and terminators.  We will also discuss how this can lead to improvements in performance for many operations through the lazy evaluation of Streams and how code can easily be made parallel by changing the way the Stream is created.","created":{"date":1405536536868},"day":{"value":"1","label":"Nov. 4th"},"experience":{"value":"e"},"from":{"h":"10","m":"00"},"language":{"value":"e","label":"English","order":"2"},"room":{"value":"r1","label":"Room1"},"speaker":{"_id":{"$oid":"53c6c91870f6aba33d9e5cb8"},"fname":"Simon","lname":"Ritter","twitter":"speakjava","bio":"Simon Ritter is head of Java technology evangelism at Oracle.

In this presentation you will see an OSGi application being built from scratch and learn about package imports and exports, dynamic services, dependency injection and integration with JAX-RS and MongoDB.
